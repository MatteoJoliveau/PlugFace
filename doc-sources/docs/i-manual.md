PlugFace can be downloaded from the GitHub Release page as JAR files.
Just download the JAR file most suitable for you and copy it in your classpath.

Don't forget to also download it's dependencies. We tried to keep them fairly limited, but you still have to
get `slf4j-api` and `javax.inject` for the core module.

If using the Spring integration you will need of course the Spring Framework at least version 4,
`commons-logging` and obviously `plugface-core`.
